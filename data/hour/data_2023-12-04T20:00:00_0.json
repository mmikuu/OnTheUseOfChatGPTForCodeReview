Chat GPT for help. Here you can find our full conversation history [https://chat.openai.com/share/b093ae6f-e16f-455c-a4d2-c2a23542111d](https://chat.openai.com/share/b093ae6f-e16f-455c-a4d2-c2a23542111d).\r\n\r\nUnfortunatelly, Chat GPT does not care very much about things like SOLID, architectural patterns, clean code, DI and testing. So the code looks to be in a **very** rough state. But it runs and meets the requirements.\r\n\r\nHowever, my goal was to finish the task in \u00b13 hours - I couldn't justify spending any more of my time on this. So this is what we're stuck with.\r\n",
