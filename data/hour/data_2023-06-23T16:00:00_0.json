If only phenotypes are given `is_feature_set` should be set to true.\r\n\r\nThis version implements both kinds of functionality, but only tells the model about the gene/disease search. In my initial test after requesting some phenotypes for a disease and then searching for similar diseases/genes, it chose to use the few phenotypes it had in hand rather than a disease->disease search. Generally it only pulls a few (5 to 10) phenotypes for an entity so we'll need to think more about implementing phenotype-array sim search, maybe with a different endpoint.\r\n\r\nBut, this implementation still trips the model up sometimes, as the search returns a mix of genes and diseases, see e.g. https://chat.openai.com/share/ed17cd4e-d32a-4162-b400-a01877f026d1",
