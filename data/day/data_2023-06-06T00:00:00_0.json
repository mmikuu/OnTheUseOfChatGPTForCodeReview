Open the invoicing software\n2. Navigate to the \"Invoices\" section\n3. Click on the \"Create New Invoice\" button\n4. Fill out the invoice details such as customer name, address, and items being invoiced\n5. Click on the \"Save\" button\n6. Preview the invoice to ensure accuracy\n7. Click on the \"Send\" button to email the invoice to the customer\n\n\n1\n\n\n1. Launch the invoicing software by clicking on its icon in the Applications folder\n2. Log in with valid credentials when prompted\n3. Once the dashboard of the invoicing software is visible, identify the \"Invoices\" tab on the left-hand side of the screen.\n4. Use the mouse cursor to click on the \"Invoices\" tab\n5. A list of existing invoices should now be visible. To create a new invoice, locate and click on the \"Create New Invoice\" button, usually positioned at the top of the screen.\n6. Fill out the required fields in the invoice form presented on the screen. This will usually include details such as the customer name, address, payment terms, itemized list, etc.\n7. To add a new item to the invoice, use the mouse cursor to click on the \"Add Item\" or \"+\" button that appears at the bottom of the itemized list.\n8. Enter the details of the new item and ensure that the total amount automatically updates.\n9. Repeat these steps as necessary to add all items to the invoice.\n10. Once the invoice is complete, click on the \"Save\" button, usually located at the bottom or top of the screen.\n11. Use the mouse cursor to choose whether the invoice should be marked as \"Draft\" or \"Sent.\"\n12. To view the invoice, use the mouse cursor to click on the \"Preview\" or \"View\" button on the screen.\n13. A preview of the invoice will open in a new window, where you can double-check all details before proceeding.\n14. To email the invoice to the customer, click on the \"Send\" button, usually located at the bottom or top of the screen.\n15. An email form will appear on the screen where you can enter the details of the recipient, such as email address and a custom message.\n16. Click on the \"Send\" button to finalize sending the invoice.\n\n\n2\n\n\n1. Turn on the computer\n2. Log in with valid credentials when prompted\n3. Navigate to the desktop or taskbar and locate the invoicing software icon.\n4. Use the mouse cursor to click on the invoicing software icon\n5. Wait for the invoicing software to fully load and display the login screen\n6. Enter valid login credentials and click on the \"Login\" button\n7. Wait for the dashboard to load and then find the \"Invoices\" section on the left-hand sidebar\n8. Click on the \"Invoices\" section to reveal the menu items underneath\n9. To create a new invoice, select the \"Create New Invoice\" option from the menu\n10. Fill out the required fields such as customer name, address, and items being invoiced, using the keyboard or mouse to make selections as necessary\n11. Use the mouse to click on the \"Save\" button, located at the bottom or top of the screen, to save the newly created invoice\n12. Preview the invoice by clicking on the \"Preview\" button, usually located next to the \"Save\" button, and examine it closely for accuracy\n13. If all information is correct, click on the \"Send\" button to email the invoice to the customer.\n14. Compose a message to the customer in the email form that appears on the screen\n15. Click on the \"Send\" button in the email form to finalize sending the invoice. \n\nAs we can see, the hierarchy can be very granular, from simply turning on a computer and clicking a few buttons to the minute details of filling in a form, entering information, and previewing an invoice. By going through each level of the hierarchy, we can see the various processes and actions that must be taken to accomplish a task such as generating invoices.",
