Here are some quick stats:\n\nOn September 14, a backup is 40MB\nOn May 18, a backup was 32MB\nThis puts our backup growth rate at about 0.05MB/day (if we pretend it's linear)\n24 backups/day\nsum((40 + 0.05 * i) * 24 for i in range(365)) = 430116.0, or we will have about 430GB of backups in the cloud in 1 year.\n\nObviously, the majority of data from one backup to the next is redundant.\nWe should not be able to delete data from the pwn.college server.\nI think S3 lets us tag our uploads, and then we can have different \"transitions\" dependent on the tag.\nProbably something like this makes sense:\n\nWe always keep the first backup of the month. (Transition it to Glacier Deep Archive after a year)\nWe keep the first backup of the week for 6 months.\nWe keep the first backup of the day for 30 days.\nWe keep everything for 5 days.\n\nMore likely than not, if theres a massive data issue, we'll probably know about it within 5 days, or something has gone really wrong. Worst case though, we have the other backups policies to draw from :)\nhttps://chat.openai.com/share/10bdda73-2fbe-4a5b-bba2-2c383bb8115b",

What's worse is that ChatGPT, although it's awful at making real extensions, is really good at making things that look real, which makes people submit them in good faith and end up wasting a lot of our time fixing a broken heap of garbage. Sometimes we fix issues ourselves, other times we ask the author to fix it.

According to ~~Wikipedia~~ reliable scientific sources, velocity is the change of position over time, which means that it includes the direction of movement. Since we are dealing with 3D spaces, this means that velocity is a vector. The thing that we used to call \"velocity\", i.e. the magnitude of the change of position over time, is called \"speed\". So I renamed the `Velocity` unit to `Speed` and added velocity geometry helpers",
