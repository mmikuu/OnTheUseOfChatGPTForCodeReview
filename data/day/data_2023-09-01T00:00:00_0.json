                                    "bodyText": "Thank you @KrishPatel13 !\nIt's a bit verbose. Why not use getenv_fallback?\nI asked ChatGPT for input here: https://chat.openai.com/share/7ddeca53-1174-4686-b82d-0ad305d2d1d3 :\n\nFor managing configuration in a Python project more elegantly, while avoiding repetitive code, you can use libraries like pydantic, environs, or python-decouple. Each of these offers unique features and simplifies the process of handling environment variables and configuration settings. Here's a brief overview of each approach:\n1. Pydantic\nPydantic is known for its data validation using Python type annotations. It can be especially useful for loading and validating configurations.\n\nDefine a configuration model using Pydantic classes.\nSet default values and types directly in the class definition.\nLoad and validate environment variables automatically.\n\nExample:\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Config(BaseModel):\n    cache_dir_path: str = Field(default=\".cache\")\n    cache_enabled: bool = Field(default=True)\n    cache_verbosity: int = Field(default=0)\n    db_echo: bool = Field(default=False)\n    db_fname: str = Field(default=\"openadapt.db\")\n\nconfig = Config(_env_file='.env')\n2. Environs\nEnvirons is a library that wraps around marshmallow to provide simple environment variable parsing.\n\nDefine schema for your environment variables.\nUse methods to cast variables to the correct type.\nCan handle complex data types and validation.\n\nExample:\nfrom environs import Env\n\nenv = Env()\nenv.read_env()  # read .env file, if it exists\n\n# Define variables with type casting\ncache_dir_path = env.str(\"CACHE_DIR_PATH\", \".cache\")\ncache_enabled = env.bool(\"CACHE_ENABLED\", True)\ncache_verbosity = env.int(\"CACHE_VERBOSITY\", 0)\ndb_echo = env.bool(\"DB_ECHO\", False)\ndb_fname = env.str(\"DB_FNAME\", \"openadapt.db\")\n3. Python-Decouple\nPython-Decouple is focused on separating settings from code, which is useful for 12-factor applications.\n\nSimple API for accessing environment variables.\nSupports type casting and default values.\nClean and straightforward for basic needs.\n\nExample:\nfrom decouple import config\n\nCACHE_DIR_PATH = config('CACHE_DIR_PATH', default='.cache')\nCACHE_ENABLED = config('CACHE_ENABLED', cast=bool, default=True)\nCACHE_VERBOSITY = config('CACHE_VERBOSITY', cast=int, default=0)\nDB_ECHO = config('DB_ECHO', cast=bool, default=False)\nDB_FNAME = config('DB_FNAME', default='openadapt.db')\nChoosing the Right Tool\n\nPydantic: Best for complex configurations with a need for strict type validation.\nEnvirons: Useful for more complex data types and custom validation logic.\nPython-Decouple: Ideal for simpler use cases where the primary goal is to separate configuration from code.\n\nEach of these libraries reduces the repetitive nature of environment variable management and adds the benefit of type checking and validation, making your configuration management both more elegant and robust.\n\nSince we are already using Pydantic in https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/OpenAdapt/blob/main/openadapt/privacy/base.py#L6 I think it makes sense to re-use it here.

Would be better if it only takes 100% and with a flex-grow: 1.\nExpected behaviour: The error page content should take as much space at it can, without creating an overflow.\n\n\nThat is doable, however will yield basically this look:\n\n\nHeight and display would have to be adjusted on the app-error-page element, as well as a few parent elements of it to achieve the desired height. \nVH might be good enough for now considering there are a lot of other implementations that could be better as well.\nUnless we want to demonstrate a proper way of doing things - Is that a purpose of this repo?\n\nYes maybe a cath\n\nAnother possible improvement would be to not redirect to 404, and just show the 404 page if the route does not exist.\nLike that: https://angular.io/guide/router-tutorial#adding-a-404-page\nThis is how they suggest it in the angular docs above - and is not a more complicated way of doing things. I feel like its better UX to stay on the route to show that it doesn't exist.\n\nYes, maybe a cathch all route is preferrable? I kinda did that with the React demo example.",

The User can `Enable` the mode from Settings. Tauri will spawn a thread that installs the dependencies and runs the python process.\r\n\r\nThe PR contains all the building blocks in order to implement the complete POC functionality.\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\n\r\n- UI/UX must be drastically improved. No CSS changes have been made.\r\n- It currently works only if the User has Python installed on its machine.\r\n\r\n@tiero @casperdcl @sekulicd @Janaka-Steph please have a look.",

Specifically, these functions enable us to check the running status of Swarm Mode, start it, and stop it when needed.\n\n\nAddition of SwarmMode Component\nA new component named SwarmMode is created to incorporate Docker's Swarm Mode features into our application UI. This component is added as part of our Settings module, empowering users with more operational flexibility.\n\n\nUtilities for Swarm Mode\nAdditional utility functions for handling Docker Swarm Mode are implemented. These help us to verify the operational status of Swarm Mode, stop it, or start it based on user input or application requirements.",
