That won't matter to dcicutils itself, but it does matter if anything in this code calls the ff_mocks (and there may be places I would argue it should because ff_mocks does useful setup you don't want to have to duplicate). So if you're going to do it this way, please set up and use a a utils beta sooner rather than later that moves all support for anything you're isolating in this way, so presumably the boto_sqs stuff as well.\nI do have a bit of hesitation about doing it this way instead of just monkey-patching boto3.resource and boto3.client to something that wraps the original definition. The reasons that argue for that are (1) there could conceivably be calls inside system code that accesses these things and wants to be consistent - not sure if that can happen so maybe not a concern, (2) it's way more modular, (3) less likelihood that someone uninformed with our practices will make a patch that doesn't realize they have to do this.\nAnother strategy would be to fully replace use of boto3 itself within our sources with some other class that just knows to call boto3 in most cases but that substitutes appropriate support where it wants to. This would mean that you didn't have to know which boto3 functions are overridden and which not.\nI'm a little worried this is destroys the look-and-feel of ordinary AWS programming and makes the code less palatable to an open-source community.\nI wonder if we should just propose the change to the AWS community. Although there are security considerations. Hijacking an application by re-pointing its environment to an ersatz environ might be easier than some other exploits.  It might be that any such proposal shouldn't be to use an environment variable but instead to just allow programmatic override (vaguely equivalent to monkey patching, and then we could add the environment variable as a way to get the value, but others could use either hard-wired code or access to a config file. More options.) Something like boto3.set_s3_url(...) or something like that where we could get our arg from an env var, but others could use their own scheme. Is there really not such a feature already?\nIssues of where this is homed aside, I think this will suffice for now, but I'm uneasy about it.\n(What I should do is make a way for a downstream library to extend the mocking behavior without making a utils replacement. I think that could easily be done. But for now that's the way.)\nI do like the functionality this gets. I just feel like the syntactic mechanism is ugly because it replaces an object-oriented thing with a non-object-oriented thing in a way that is going to feel unmotivated and inflexible and that may not be really general-purpose because it's too easy to have something that's not participating in the illusion if there is code that calls these behind its own abstraction walls. That's a serious impediment to correct operation.",

If you change the order of tokens, using boto3_client_sqs, then searches for 'boto3.client.*sqs' can find boto3.client('sqs') and boto3.client(\"sqs\"). This may not matter, but I'm trained to think about grep kinds of things as part of naming to promote systems with good discovery. In the Lisp community there's a function \"apropos\" that one uses to find all the defined names with a given string in any module. It doesn't search sources, it searches the in-memory set of names for each package (vaguely like a module).\nAlternatively, a name like mockable_boto3_sqs_client might give a sense of why the function was being called.",

You'd think given the constraints of the language they'd have to care more.\nLikewise, these things where you repeatedly access the foursight_header_json[\"auth\"] can be collected into header_resources = foursight_header_json.get(\"resources\", {}) so you don't have to keep repeating that part. It can sometimes make things a little easier to read. The function calls really make it messy. And it's not good style to not have a space after comma. PEP8 is going to beat you up.\n(Doing it this way might also make you ask yourself why you're going back and forth doing a bit of auth here and a bit of auth there with identity in the middle.)",

I presume that if this logic is not correct, it's because I haven't named things in the way that best represents the distinctions you're trying to make.\n\nMore like allow_action is really allow_action_to_be_manually_run_and_also_automatically_run_action_after_successful_check and prevent_action is inhibit_action_from_automatically_running. I.e. allow_action currently embodies two different things (allowing manual run by user, and enabling automatic run of action after successful check run), and the prevent_action is mean to disable the second part (running automatically after successful check run).",
