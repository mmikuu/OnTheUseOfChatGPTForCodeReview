Please, replace this line with\ngiftCertificateResponse1  = new GiftCertificate(\n\"certificate for test\", \"description for test\", 10.50, 10L);\nto create separate independent copy.",

By allocating immutable workspaces for non-incremental work we get to reuse their outputs locally more often without having to hit the build cache.\r\n\r\nA consequence of this change is that running `clean` does not remove the outputs of non-incremental project-bound transforms anymore. Only the outputs of incremental transforms will be stored in `$buildDir/.transforms`.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/26694\r\n",

For external artifacts like guava.jar we run the identify part for every subproject where the transformed JAR is needed; for large projects the difference between using the snapshot vs using the fingerprint can add up.\nOnce we change this and all transforms are discovered as part of execution graph building my expectation is that we can do this de-duplication based on the identity of the transformed dependency instead. This is just an assumption, though, that I haven't verified, so I'm okay with removing the comment here.",

But my assumption was incorrect and we don't see any regression because we anyway did a normalization already before as mentioned above.",

It suggests that the data has not been subjected to the process of normalization, and it's more of a passive state. It's commonly used in technical and scientific contexts where precision is valued.\n\n\n\"Unnormalized\" could suggest that the data was normalized at some point and has been changed back to its original state, or it could also just indicate the lack of normalization. However, in practice, \"unnormalized\" is often used in mathematics and computing to simply mean \"not normalized,\" without necessarily implying a process of denormalization.\n\n\nGiven that \"normalized\" data implies that an active process of normalization has been applied, using \"non-normalized\" would unambiguously indicate that this process has not been applied, and there is no suggestion that it is a state that has been reverted to. Thus, \"non-normalized\" might be the more technically appropriate term for your case, emphasizing that this is the default or natural state.\n\nhttps://chat.openai.com/share/2901f5fc-81a4-4c6c-a3d3-604e19e1b90f",

For project artifacts, we used a mutable workspace, so we didn't normalize the contents for the workspace location. And now instead, we put non-incremental project transforms into a normalized immutable workspace location. We did normalize the inputs of project transforms in every build, since they have not been a part of the cross-build identity cache.\nI think the main point here is that we didn't change anything for external dependencies regarding their workspaces, so this extra work doesn't show up.",
