Let me know if I am understanding this correctly.\nI like 1 conditional requirement because it sounds like it wouldn't add any installation steps for the dev on the readme.md. That's really my goal, not to add another step. If we could add a conditional install that'd be great, but I'm not aware if that's possible with brew install portaudio. As far as I'm aware I've never used pip to start a brew install command, but honestly I don't know what's possible here. If you could figure it out and resolve, I'll look at the PR again and see if it works for me, Thanks!",

Here's the update for context.\n__\n@joshbickett  message: Well that's a duesy. We really want to add accessibility to this project but we can not ask all users to run brew install portaudio. Only the users that want to use the terminal flag with-audio should have to run this. I guess \"technically\" users could just ignore ERROR: Could not build wheels for pyaudio which use PEP 517  and if they don't use with-audio then it will work fine, but that's a big problem because everyone running pip install -r requirements will see it and that'd be quite confusing.\n__\nAssistant response: You're correct in identifying the challenge of requiring all users to install additional dependencies, especially when it's only needed for a specific feature. However, there are a few strategies you could use to handle this situation more gracefully:\nOptional Dependencies: Modify your requirements.txt to only include essential packages. Then, provide a separate requirements-audio.txt for the with-audio feature, which includes PyAudio and its dependencies. In your documentation, instruct users who want to use the with-audio feature to run an additional command, like:\npip install -r requirements-audio.txt",
