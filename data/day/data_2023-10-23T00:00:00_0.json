This feature enhancement enhances the CAMEL project by providing access to current weather data based on geographical coordinates.\r\nThis update integrates features related to the OpenWeatherMap API, enabling new weather-related functionality.\r\n\r\nIn order to use these new features, an API key from OpenWeatherMap is required. Contributors and users who want to run this code will need to:\r\n\r\n1. Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap by signing up at https://openweathermap.org/api \uff08free API is enough to this function\uff09.\r\n2. Once you have the key, it should be stored securely in the environment variables as 'OPENWEATHER_API_KEY'. This is critical to ensure the security and privacy of your API key. Please do not hardcode the key into your codebase.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure the 'OPENWEATHER_API_KEY' is correctly configured in the environment before running the application. Incorrect handling of the API key may lead to errors or unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this requirement as we integrate these exciting new weather features.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n\r\n**Motivation:**\r\nWeather data is a valuable resource for a wide range of applications, from optimizing energy consumption to improving travel safety.     Users of the CAMEL project have expressed the need for a reliable and easy-to-use way to access current weather information based on geographical coordinates.     This addition of the `fetch_current_weather` API fulfills that need, providing real-time weather data to CAMEL users, enhancing their experience, and enabling new possibilities for data analysis.\r\n\r\n**Context:**\r\nPrior to this change, users had to rely on external services or implement custom solutions to obtain weather data.     The `fetch_current_weather` API simplifies this process, making it more accessible and integrated within the CAMEL framework.     This addition aligns with our project's goal of providing comprehensive and user-friendly AI capabilities.     It leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve accurate and up-to-date weather information, which complements the existing functionality of CAMEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn issue has been raised to propose this change (https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/issues/57)\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds core functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] Documentation (update in the documentation)\r\n- [ ] Example (update in the folder of example)\r\n\r\n## Implemented Tasks\r\n\r\n- [x] Current Weather\r\n- [ ] 3-hour Forecast 5 days\r\n- [ ] Basic weather maps\r\n- [ ] Air Pollution API\r\n- [ ] Geocoding API\r\n- [ ] A example of role playing with weather function\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [CONTRIBUTION](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.        (**required**)\r\n- [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation.\r\n- [x] I have updated the tests accordingly.        (*required for a bug fix or a new feature*)\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n",
