Also you should start your branch off our `main`.\r\n- [ ] Lint and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nThis is really a minimal working example somewhat outside of the package structure. It should be integrated in the package structure and the PR is being created as discussed with @AldoGl. He will make changes to this PR before integrating it.",

This means the success rate for clicking a model is drastically increased. It now gets a random polygon and finds a point within that to click on.\r\n- Added withdrawAll function to Bank\r\n- Added hasAction to RSObject\r\n\r\n### Bugs found\r\nSee Inventory.java:175 the condition is always true. Author: @Fire-Swan\r\nSee RSModel.java:343 this loop always returns with n=0. Author(s): @PhobicHD and/or @GigiaJ \r\n",

If that is not on screen or it does not exist, the old system is used. The old system tries to get a center polygon of the model on screen. If that also fails, the new system is used which tries to get a random polygon on the screen. The latter does not look specifically for a center and may therefore hit a polygon which is on screen while the middle of the model is not on screen.\nCombining these three methods creates a very high success rate for many shapes.\nI also changed the click to allow a user to specify how many tries the mouse makes to move onto the object.

The problem is because of the screen projection the majority of triangles are going to be at or near the edge of the model in 2d screen space. Couple this together with the fact the model or camera may be moving and the mouse takes time to move. This causes moving the mouse to a model to fail most of the time at least when the model or camera is moving at all. I think that we can actually get the click hitbox somehow and take the center point of that which makes more sense but I didn't spend the time to figure it out. Ideally, our mouse movement would update while moving so it always finished on the model but that isn't how it works currently. Regardless, I don't think this is a good change even though on the surface it seems like a better way to do it. Oh also the name is definitely not apt with this change.",
