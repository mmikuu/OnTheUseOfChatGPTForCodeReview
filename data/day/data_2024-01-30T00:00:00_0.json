I think I have something misconfigured that's not part of the Mudlet repo. I placed `MimeType=x-scheme-handler/telnet;application/zip;` in `mudlet.desktop` and ran `xdg-mime default mudlet.desktop x-scheme-handler/telnet` to set default.\r\n\r\nTesting: open http://www.durismud.com and click on on the `Play now` link.",
