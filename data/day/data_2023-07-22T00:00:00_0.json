Eventually it became awkward to make each public in Mainwindow and then include Mainwindow.  It created circular includes.  Eventually I started making those singletons with the get instance.\nMemory Leaks:\nYes I'm sure there are leaks and back in the days when Visual Studio was more affordable and I used MFC it had memory leak detection in the IDE.  When I switched to Qt that was no longer available and I have never found the method for Qt on windows  without Visual Studio to get leak detection.    I missed it greatly and forged ahead.\nSo any help there would be very good.  Also if one leaves DFTFringe running on a windows machine it eats up CPU usage.  Why?\nArmadillo was once needed by Mike Pecks PSI and/or Zernike generation software.  I never actually implemented all of what I intended of Mike stuff.  So I have lost track of what of it was used.  I think there may have been some templated objects.  I'm likely never to do the original intention.",

In fact also checking for null in the getInstance() is potentially just a precaution.  So I have absolutely no issues with that way of doing things.",

This really helps.\nAbout the singleton design pattern I simply want to share 2 infos:\n\nPopularity of this pattern has decreased a lot. Now, this pattern should be avoided in most situations. I like this website but all recent ressources are agreeing on this point. https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Ri-singleton\nWhen using it, it should be updated to modern C++ (>=C++11). The new design pattern is still roughly the same but it is safer.\n\nStandards are evolving, it doesn't mean the code is bad. I think it is important that we know it should be avoided but the changes would probably be quite complex. I would not see this change as high priority except if we start chasing memory leaks with Valgring or other tools.\nI also had an interesting/long discussion with ChatGPT https://chat.openai.com/c/97c005b1-0940-4985-9978-076532dab7ad\nBut this is more for your information. I'm sure there are plenty of better ressources on the internet. No need to read it all. If you still read it, note that alternative approach 1 is probably the cleanest even if not the easiest.",

This data needs to remain around and stable as long as the app lives and then closing the app deletes it.  Since the deletes happen by the app close no specific delete is needed nor desired.  I would hope the leak detector understands that case.  IIRC the old Visual Studio leak detector did.\nEach singleton is a manager of that data and can give clients views into it.  There can only be one manger for each related state data store.\nIn the old days of C they would have been global variables but are much better grouped by classes now I think.",
