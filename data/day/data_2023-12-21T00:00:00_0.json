However, getting a 400 when attempting to retrieve v1 using the \"ticket\". I have a feeling this is to do with missing cookies that need to be passed so need to fetch those from the sign-in -> ticket call return entity.\r\n\r\nThis is based on the great insights by matin and referencing https://github.com/matin/garth/blob/6aeb0faaf0d6b473d8dc161373068d2f5413fdfe/garth/sso.py#L21.\r\n\r\nI'm in and out over the Christmas period but will pick this up when I can. The foundational logic flow has been typed up at least :)",

In my mind, the next steps (either for this PR or a separate PR) will be:\n\nAdd support for MFA (this will require a user input)\nAdd support for saving and renewing OAuth2 tokens (this will prevent MFA users from having to enter a code for every upload and may generally speed up the upload process slightly)\n\nI had to remove the redirection logic that was present after the ticket is obtained. For some reason this invalidated the ticket. I don't know if this is unneeded legacy code or whether it covers a case that my configuration doesn't replicate. As I didn't see similar logic in the garth login flow, I dropped it.",
