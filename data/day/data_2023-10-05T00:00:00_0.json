IssueType was created before but in some places, string was used. This PR resolves that issue. \r\n\r\nAlong with those, ruff and isort which are linting and import formatting tools, respectively, added to in requirements. \r\n\r\nIf `isort` and `ruff` are not desired, I can remove them from the commits\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: This PR will be merged after https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanvision/pull/227/files if it is merged. Then, we can get rid of the commits from that PR (by rebasing onto main). Currently, we see those changes here which will be gone after the rebasing.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n> What is the scope of your changes and who/where do you think they will affect?\r\n\r\nSmall code clean up and some formatting. Along with that additional installations. Normally, these installations should not go into production code, they should stay in `dev` but I am not sure how to do that in the current setting. In the future, by separating requirements from requirements-dev.txt, we may be able to achieve that. \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n> What testing have you done and verified? Please link to the one unit test that is most end-to-end check of your new functionality. It's ok if your unit tests are not yet comprehensive when you first open the PR, we can revisit them later!  \r\n\r\n- to be done\r\n\r\n## Ticket(s) or Conversations\r\n\r\n> What Git or Slack items (Issues, threads etc) are specifically related to this work? Please link them here.\r\n\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n> Include any extra information that may be helpful to reviewers of your Pull-Request here (e.g. relevant URLs or Wiki pages that could help give background information). If relevant, please include additional code snippets (and their outputs/return values) showing alternative ways to use your newly added methods.\r\n\r\n-\r\n",

We do ignore some errors in flake8, so there might be room for improvement.\nHowever, ruff is not set up in the CI/pre-commit steps, and it's not clear what unique help it brings to the project.\nSuggestion\nFor this PR, I suggest we keep the formatting improvements but remove the ruff dependency until we have a clearer understanding of its benefits. I propose we move the discussion about ruff to another Github Issue to explore if it solves anything new, or if there are other strong reasons to include it. This way, we keep the PR focused while exploring the linting tools and practices separately.\n  \n    \n      \n        Suggested change\n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            ruff",
