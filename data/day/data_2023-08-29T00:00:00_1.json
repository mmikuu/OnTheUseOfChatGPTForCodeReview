I think I have something misconfigured that's not part of the Mudlet repo. I placed `MimeType=x-scheme-handler/telnet;application/zip;` in `mudlet.desktop` and ran `xdg-mime default mudlet.desktop x-scheme-handler/telnet` to set default.\r\n\r\nTesting: open http://www.durismud.com and click on on the `Play now` link.",

IssueType was created before but in some places, string was used. This PR resolves that issue. \r\n\r\nAlong with those, ruff and isort which are linting and import formatting tools, respectively, added to in requirements. \r\n\r\nIf `isort` and `ruff` are not desired, I can remove them from the commits\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: This PR will be merged after https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanvision/pull/227/files if it is merged. Then, we can get rid of the commits from that PR (by rebasing onto main). Currently, we see those changes here which will be gone after the rebasing.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n> What is the scope of your changes and who/where do you think they will affect?\r\n\r\nSmall code clean up and some formatting. Along with that additional installations. Normally, these installations should not go into production code, they should stay in `dev` but I am not sure how to do that in the current setting. In the future, by separating requirements from requirements-dev.txt, we may be able to achieve that. \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n> What testing have you done and verified? Please link to the one unit test that is most end-to-end check of your new functionality. It's ok if your unit tests are not yet comprehensive when you first open the PR, we can revisit them later!  \r\n\r\n- to be done\r\n\r\n## Ticket(s) or Conversations\r\n\r\n> What Git or Slack items (Issues, threads etc) are specifically related to this work? Please link them here.\r\n\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n> Include any extra information that may be helpful to reviewers of your Pull-Request here (e.g. relevant URLs or Wiki pages that could help give background information). If relevant, please include additional code snippets (and their outputs/return values) showing alternative ways to use your newly added methods.\r\n\r\n-\r\n",

We do ignore some errors in flake8, so there might be room for improvement.\nHowever, ruff is not set up in the CI/pre-commit steps, and it's not clear what unique help it brings to the project.\nSuggestion\nFor this PR, I suggest we keep the formatting improvements but remove the ruff dependency until we have a clearer understanding of its benefits. I propose we move the discussion about ruff to another Github Issue to explore if it solves anything new, or if there are other strong reasons to include it. This way, we keep the PR focused while exploring the linting tools and practices separately.\n  \n    \n      \n        Suggested change\n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            ruff",

                        "body": "Fixes #14007 \r\nAddresses https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/25676 and https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/25366\r\n\r\nI have written this with the goal of using a purely SymPy-based backend (or SymPy as a part of SageMath) in [symtex.el](https://github.com/ultronozm/symtex.el) and [compuTeX](https://github.com/8vasu/compuTeX). I wish to unify the typesetting and computation aspects of working with matrix groups in my GNU Emacs/AUCTeX-based workflow. \r\n\r\nEdit: I do not mean to rush anyone, but the reason for this PR is that the `latex2sympy2` that we are currently using in our projects depends on ANTLR 4.7, which imports `typing.io`. We keep getting  warnings that `typing.io` is deprecated and that it will be completely removed in Python 3.12. Currently I am using the default Python 3.11 in Debian, but that might change in an OS update/upgrade in the near future. We have found a parsing solution using GNU Emacs Calc, but we depend on SymPy's `parse_expr` anyway. Matrices are a must for us, and I am looking for a clean solution that just uses `parse_latex`.\r\n\r\nEdit: This PR is being split into 2 parts. Currently this only has content for the Lark parser. The following message remains unchanged, and still mentions ANTLR, which is to be ignored.\r\n\r\nEdit: added `\\prime` and `\\ast` as new ways of performing matrix transpose and matrix self-adjoint.\r\n\r\n## Overview of features added or modified:\r\n\r\n1. Matrix parsing is added to both the ANTLR-based and the\r\nLark-based parsers.\r\n2. Literal complex numbers are introduced via the LaTeX macro\r\n`\\sympyi` in order to facilitate working with matrices with complex\r\nnumber entries.\r\n3. Since the single quote (prime) symbol is sometimes used to denote\r\nmatrix transpose, that is introduced, and as a side-effect, primed\r\nsymbols are added to the Lark parser, and the behavior of primes\r\non symbols in ANTLR and Lark are made consistent and completely\r\nfaithful to the input. For example, the input `\"a''_{b'''}''''\"`\r\ngenerates `sympy.Symbol(\"a''_{b'''}''''\")`. Before this commit, the\r\nANTLR-based parser would generate `sympy.Symbol(\"a_{b'}\")` from the\r\ninput `\"a_b'\"`; LaTeX compilers interpret this differently: the\r\nprime in `\"a_b'\"` is rendered on the `\"a\"` as opposed to the `\"b\"`. This\r\ncommit follows the convention followed by LaTeX compilers.\r\n\r\n## List of features added:\r\n\r\n1. Imaginary unit: `\\sympyi`\r\n2. Matrix parsing (`array` and AMS-LaTeX `matrix`, `pmatrix`, `bmatrix`)\r\nand detailed error handling\r\n3. Determinant parsing (`\\det`, `vmatrix`, `|array matrix|`,\r\n`|AMS-LaTeX matrix|`)\r\n4. Transpose via superscripts `^T`, `^{T}`, `^{'}`, `'`. Applied multiple\r\ntimes via `''`, `'''`, ..., `^{''}`, `^{'''}`, ...\r\n5. Conjugate transpose via superscripts `^H`, `^{H}`, `^{*}`. Applied\r\nmultiple times via `^{**}`, `^{***}`, ...\r\n6. Matrix Trace: `\\sympytr`\r\n7. Matrix adjugate: `\\sympyadj`\r\n8. The above matrix functionality works on all matrix expressions\r\nand not just individual literal matrices; for example, `\\det` can\r\nbe applied to the sum of 2 LaTeX matrices.\r\n9. Large number of new tests for all new functionality.\r\n\r\n## List of features modified:\r\n\r\n1. Symbols (one letter, greek, multi-letter, subscripted) can have\r\nprimes (single quotes) on them in the Lark grammar.\r\n2. Primes on output symbols and functions are now completely\r\nfaithful to the input strings (see added tests).\r\n3. In the Lark grammar, integral, derivative, and limit\r\nexpressions have been moved from `_expression_mul` to `_expression_func`\r\nso that, for instance, integrals can be multiplied with each other.\r\n4. In the Lark grammar, the rule `adjacent_expressions` has been\r\nmodified so that `\"fraction _expression\"` is now\r\n`\"fraction _expression_mul\"`. This is done to eliminate the incorrect\r\nalternatives in the ambiguous interpretations of `\\frac{a}{b} x+y`,\r\n`\\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{x}{y}`, `\\frac{a}{b} - \\frac{x}{y}`, etc.\r\n5. The Lark grammar now understands `\"+ expression\"` as just\r\n`\"expression\"`.\r\n6. Some tests have been modified to reflect change in behavior.\r\n\r\n    Relevant issue: https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/14007\r\n\r\n#### Release Notes\r\n\r\n<!-- Write the release notes for this release below between the BEGIN and END\r\nstatements.

This wouldn't be an everyday requirement, but might help us quickly troubleshoot SSO setup with institution admins.\r\n\r\nThe User Settings page seemed like a reasonable place to display some additional authn information. This PR adds a \"?debug\" query flag to the page to enable embedding more information. There is a toggle for this mode at the bottom of the page -- if we want this functionality to be more hidden, we can remove the visible link to debug mode.\r\n\r\nRight now it only shows LTI 1.3 authentication data from the session. That still needs to be saved there; either in this PR or a different one.",
