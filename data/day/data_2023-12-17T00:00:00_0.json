And different schedulers are not possible, as in \"ipvs\".\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\nFor start this is a PoC.\r\n\r\nA more suitable name than `numgen` should probably be used in the proxier structure. Trying to look into the future, one might expect some new features in nftables, like maglev-hashing\", and make it possible to configure those future things without altering the config API, just use a new value for some distribution parameter.\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n\r\n```release-note\r\nAllow users to configure the distribution in proxy-mode=nftables to mimic proxy-mode=ipvs with round-robin\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Additional documentation e.g., KEPs (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals), usage docs, etc.:\r\n\r\n\r\n",

But when more people start to use the nftables proxier, there may be a wish for this feature, I have in particular maglev-hashing in mind.\nMaglev-hashing is not a silver bullet, but it is a super-smart and simple algorithm to cope with hash reconfiguration. An example is if ECMP is used to distribute traffic to loadBalancer address among K8s nodes. Say we have 10 K8s nodes and a simple hash for ecmp. If you add an 11'th K8s node, you will have a rehash of ECMP, and will lose ~90% of all external connections.\nIf kube-proxy on the nodes uses maglev-hashing, the algorithm will hash to the same target as before for most connections. A slice of the connections, ~10%, will go to the newcomer, but ~90% of the connections will survive.\n/close\n\nInstructions for interacting with me using PR comments are available here.
