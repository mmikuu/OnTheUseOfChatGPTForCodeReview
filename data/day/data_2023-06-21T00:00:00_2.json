                        "body": "## What?\r\nI created the models that will allow us to support quests having multiple questions. I also created CRUDL views to allow teachers to create/view/edit/delete questions for quests. For any quest, they can access these views by clicking the new \"Edit Questions\" button beside the \"Edit Prerequisites\" button. Finally, I added the functionality for students to submit their answers to questions. \r\n\r\nThe new models implement the following ER diagram:\r\n\r\n![question_uml](https://github.com/bytedeck/bytedeck/assets/11304586/2fa687b5-8602-422b-8ebb-760db0f92fe1)\r\n\r\nThe dashed lines indicate weak relationships, meaning, for example, that a Question cannot exist without a Quest.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\nWith these changes, teachers can add multiple submissions to quests. This will make it easier for them to enforce that students answer certain questions, and will make multi-question quests easier for students to understand.\r\n\r\n## How?\r\n\r\n### Question and QuestionSubmission Models\r\n\r\nEverything related to questions, except for how they are used in the quest_manager app, has been moved to a new app called \"questions\".\r\n\r\n\u2757 **Edit**: I've made a few crucial design decisions since the last review, and these decisions should be evaluated:\r\n#### on_delete behavior for Questions and QuestionSubmissions\r\n- When a Question's Quest is deleted, so is the Question.\r\n- When a QuestionSubmission's Comment is deleted, so is the QuestionSubmission.\r\n- When a QuestionSubmission's Question is deleted, the QuestionSubmission is *not* deleted. This reflects the same relationship that Quests have to QuestSubmissions.\r\n\r\n#### `__str__` String representations of Questions and QuestionSubmissions\r\nThis was tricky to come up with. The string represenations needed to be different from other string representations. I thought it would make sense for a Question to be represented as `<Quest Name> (<Question Ordinal in Quest>)`, but this format is already used by QuestSubmissions, so I had to come up with something new. Below is what I went with for each object:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nclass Question(models.Model):\r\n...\r\n    def __str__(self):\r\n        \"\"\"Return string representation in format of: [Quest Name] ([Question Type] - [Question Ordinal])\r\n        e.g. \"Quest 1 (short_answer - 1)\" for the first question in the quest with name \"Quest 1\"\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        return f\"{self.quest.name} ({self.type} - {self.ordinal})\"\r\n...\r\nclass QuestionSubmission(models.Model):\r\n...\r\n    def __str__(self):\r\n        \"\"\"Return string representation in format of: [Comment datetime string] - ([question ordinal])\r\n        e.g. \"2022-3-22 1:00PM - (1)\" for the first question in the student's quest submission\r\n        If the question is None, return: [Comment datetime string] - (?)\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        comment_time = self.comment.timestamp.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %-I:%M%p\")\r\n        if self.question:\r\n            return f\"{comment_time} - ({self.question.ordinal})\"\r\n        else:\r\n            return f\"{comment_time} - (?)\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### `next_ordinal(cls, quest)` Question Class Method\r\nDeciding how to handle incrementing ordinal values was tricky. We want to ensure that Questions can be added, deleted, and reordered by teachers, and we want to avoid the problems that occurred with the Quest Submission ordinals. I tried overriding the `save()` method, overriding the `delete()` method, and creating a `reorder(self, new_position)` method, but each of these would have been out of the scope of this task. So instead, we opted for creating a simple `new_ordinal(cls, quest)` class method for the Question model. It is implemented as follows:\r\n```py\r\nclass Question(models.Model):\r\n...\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def next_ordinal(cls, quest):\r\n        \"\"\"Return the next ordinal value for a question in this quest\"\"\"\r\n        max_ordinal = Question.objects.filter(quest=quest).aggregate(Max('ordinal'))['ordinal__max']\r\n        return (max_ordinal or 0) + 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be called like so:\r\n```py\r\nfrom quest_manager.models import Quest, Question\r\n\r\nquest1 = Quest.objects.get(...)\r\nnext_ordinal_in_quest = Question.next_ordinal(quest1)\r\n\r\nnext_question = Question.objects.create(quest=quest1, ordinal=next_ordinal_in_quest, instructions='')\r\n```\r\n\r\nGo to `src/questions/models.py` for the full implementation of the question models.\r\n\r\n### Question CRUDL Views\r\n\r\nThese views can accessed through the following URLS:\r\n```py\r\npath('<int:quest_id>/questions/', views.QuestionListView.as_view(), name='question_list'),\r\npath('<int:quest_id>/questions/create/<str:question_type>', views.QuestionCreateView.as_view(),\r\n     name='question_create'),\r\npath('<int:quest_id>/questions/<int:pk>/', views.QuestionUpdateView.as_view(), name='question_update'),\r\npath('<int:quest_id>/questions/<int:pk>/delete/', views.QuestionDeleteView.as_view(), name='question_delete'),\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full implementations for these views can be seen in `src/questions/views.py`.\r\n\r\n### QuestionSubmission Views\r\nWith these changes, when a student fills in their responses for a multi-question quest, they will be shown a form for each question. And teachers can view their responses in a dropdown menu underneath their submission comment.\r\n\r\nPlease see the screenshots below.\r\n\r\n## Testing?\r\n- Tests for Question and QuestionSubmission models in `questions/tests/test_models.py`.\r\n    - 23 new tests\r\n- Tests for Question CRUDL views in `questions/tests/test_views.py`\r\n    - 20 new tests\r\n- Tests for QuestionSubmissions in `quest_manager/tests/test_views.py`\r\n    - SubmissionViewTests\r\n    - `test_ajax_save_draft_has_changes`\r\n    - `test_ajax_save_draft_question_has_changes`\r\n    - `test_ajax_save_draft_question_file_upload`\r\n    - `test_ajax_save_draft_question_file_wrong_type_rejected`\r\n    - `test_ajax_save_draft_questions_no_changes`\r\n    - `test_question_submission_form_fields_for_types`\r\n    - `test_students_can_view_past_question_submissions`\r\n    - `test_teachers_can_view_past_question_submissions`\r\n    - `test_student_cannot_see_solutions_or_notes`\r\n    - `test_teachers_can_see_solutions_and_notes`\r\n    - `test_question_submissions_created_for_new_submission`\r\n    - `test_question_submissions_and_comment_not_created_with_existing_submissions`\r\n    - `test_comment_and_questions_deleted_on_drop`\r\n    - SubmissionCompleteViewTest\r\n    - `test_submit_questions`\r\n    - `test_submit_file_question`\r\n    - `test_students_must_complete_required_questions`\r\n    - `test_questions_allowed_file_type`\r\n- Revised tests for QuestSubmissions in `quest_manager/tests/test_models.py` (due to change of draft_text to draft_comment)\r\n    - `test_submission_mark_completed`\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if front end is affected)\r\n![image](https://github.com/bytedeck/bytedeck/assets/11304586/ef3fa24c-2b03-4834-88cb-cd5b7c239d61)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bytedeck/bytedeck/assets/11304586/9b6a734c-6cb9-4e17-894b-67d99f50a10c)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bytedeck/bytedeck/assets/11304586/3735f9a0-1207-4afd-b6d1-3595037ba482)\r\n\r\nInstructors can see a table of questions, and can easily click to edit or delete them.\r\n![image](https://github.com/bytedeck/bytedeck/assets/11304586/9e963381-da99-447d-9471-14d3caf8a782)\r\n\r\nStudents can see a list of questions for a quest in their version of the quest detailed view.\r\n![image](https://github.com/bytedeck/bytedeck/assets/11304586/ad23f4f5-f467-4abe-8080-2eeaebd01d7f)\r\n\r\nAbove the original quest submission field, a formset of question response fields is shown. This is where the student responds to the quest questions.\r\n![image](https://github.com/bytedeck/bytedeck/assets/11304586/5ecc2b47-9242-448b-b2db-e81fda89cea6)\r\n\r\nQuestion responses can be viewed in a table by clicking the \"Question Submissions\" dropdown.\r\n![image](https://github.com/bytedeck/bytedeck/assets/11304586/a9da9674-4714-496d-9f3e-7e581197454d)\r\n\r\nTeachers are shown a different view of question submissions that includes solutions and marker notes:\r\n![image](https://github.com/bytedeck/bytedeck/assets/11304586/2fb0ba92-0e0f-451e-a313-7a223b2d7d2b)\r\n\r\n## Anything Else?\r\nNone of the frontend code is setup to look good on mobile devices. I suggest that we create an issue for it, and work on doing that in a brand-new PR, after this one is merged.\r\n\r\nI also wanted to mention that a lot of the question content is truncated, since it is difficult to show a lot of content in a table. For this reason, I added tooltips to the question table shown below. I'm not sure how to show this in a screenshot, but the full content of the instructions and solutions can be seen in a bootstrap tooltip by hovering over the content.\r\n![image](https://github.com/bytedeck/bytedeck/assets/11304586/8d6d26d9-b719-4759-8198-bf1c6eca1469)\r\n\r\n## Review request\r\n@tylerecouture\r\n",

I guess my rational was that doing  Question.objects.filter(quest=quest).aggregate(Max('ordinal'))['ordinal__max'] is getting just a single number from the database. But if  we did Question.objects.filter(quest=quest).last().ordinal, I think it's getting the whole object and then the value afterwards?\nPerformance gains for this are probably negligible though, so maybe Question.objects.filter(quest=quest).last().ordinal is better since it is more readable?",
