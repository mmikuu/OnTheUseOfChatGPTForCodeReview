This commit creates an Auth component in the frontend that can trigger an environment-based authentication.\r\n\r\nOn Qt and Webdev the authentication succeds automatically, while on Android it requires the user to complete the system biometric authentication every time the app is resumed (.i.e. at startup and when the app comes to foreground after being put in the background).\r\n\r\nThe authentication check can be requested by the frontend using the `auth` endpoint.\r\n\r\nAuthentication messages from backend to frontend are sent via three new notifications:\r\n- 'auth-required': which triggers a new `authenticate` call from the frontend Auth component\r\n- 'auth-ok': which means authentication completed successfully\r\n- 'auth-err': which means authentication failed or has been canceled by the user.\r\n\r\nThere is also a `trigger-auth` endpoint that can be used by frontend components to trigger a new authentication flow (making the backend send a new `auth-required` notification).\r\n\r\nNOTES: \r\n- the authentication screen is just a draft and will need some styling in a future PR",

                        "body": "**Description:**\r\n\r\nThis PR relates to issue #172 and introduces several key updates to the tournament management system, focusing on the capabilities of non-staff users. The changes are aimed at providing non-staff users with greater autonomy in creating and managing tournaments while maintaining necessary oversight and control mechanisms. The updates include modifications to both the front-end (CRUD pages) and the back-end (Tournament model and related views).\r\n\r\n**Key Changes:**\r\n\r\n1. **Tournament Creation with Token Usage**: Non-staff users can now create tournaments, deducting one token from their account per tournament created. This enforces a token-based permission system, integrating with the User team's token management functionality.\r\n\r\n2. **Partial Edit Control for Tournament Creators**: Creators of a tournament (non-staff users who created a tournament) have been granted partial editing control over their tournaments. This includes updating certain attributes of the tournament. However, they cannot add or remove matches or players \u2013 actions which require staff intervention.\r\n\r\n3. **Access Control on Tournaments**: Non-staff users can only access tournaments they are part of. The `TournamentListView` has been modified to filter out tournaments that the user is not participating in, enhancing privacy and focus.\r\n\r\n4. **Restriction on Tournament Deletion**: Non-staff users are not permitted to delete or disable tournaments they created. Such actions must be routed through staff users due to the complex backend events triggered by a tournament's deletion.\r\n\r\n5. **Model Enhancements**: The `Tournament` model has been updated to include a `created_by` field, ensuring clarity on ownership. This field is critical for implementing the above functionalities, particularly around editing permissions and access control.\r\n\r\n**Technical Details:**\r\n\r\n- `TournamentCreateView` and `TournamentUpdateView` have been modified to check the user's token balance and ownership, respectively. `TournamentCreateView` deducts one token for each tournament created.\r\n- The `Tournament` model's `created_by` field links to the `User` model, establishing tournament ownership.\r\n- The `get_queryset` method in `TournamentListView` filters tournaments based on user participation and staff status.\r\n- `distribute_tokens()` is a future-proof function for automatically reloading each user\u2019s token balance after 30 days. It has been commented out so that the Users group can make necessary modifications to their `User` model beforehand.",

The distribute_token() function is commented out in this PR because I cannot change the User model without the Users group discretion. This prevents me from manually adding a last_token_addition attribute which is necessary for a full implementation of distribute_token(). However, I am leaving it in this PR so that the Users group can easily add it in the future.",

I would prefer if you could just remove the delete button for non-staff users instead of leading to a forbidden page (or at least it should be redirecting the user back to the tournament detail page with an error message).\nA couple of things I'd like to see in the next commit:\n\nPartial edit control needs to be fixed (removing or adding players). See my comment for more details\nInstead of taking users to a forbidden page (after trying to create without enough tokens, updating, deleting, etc.), I'd like for it to redirect back to the tournaments page instead. Reference some previous PRs from your team for code that includes messages.error and return(redirect)",

With the groundbreaking and pioneering work that the LocalStack team and our community are conducting on a daily basis, we have demonstrated that it is indeed possible to fundamentally re-think the way how modern cloud applications are developed. Some cloud providers like Cloudflare have already embarked on a local-first API development journey, and we anticipate that others will follow the lead. LocalStack will be in a prime position to offer a unified developer platform that facilitates local multi-cloud development across various providers and managed services - metaphorically becoming the central \"app store\" for local cloud developer tooling.\n\nUnsure about the last sentence, could probably also be removed/revised, or we find a better metaphor..",
