This object now has a `reader` optional field defaulting to `\"xarray.open_dataset\"` where you can define the reader function you want to use to open a file or file-like object into a Dataset. Some example using `\"xarray.open_mfdataset\"` is defined [here](https://github.com/rom-py/rompy/blob/flixible-souce-file/tests/test_data.py#L141-L147).\r\n\r\nThe approach you have implemented in https://github.com/rom-py/rompy/pull/34 is also perfectly valid and would work fine. My personal preference though would be generalising `SourceFile` a bit as implemented here, and having less of these `Source` objects which should really only handle a few specific corner cases - for most cases we should be able to abstract other complexities using `intake` (I agree for example with the good suggestion from @pbranson in https://github.com/rom-py/rompy/issues/33).\r\n\r\nThe new [reader](https://github.com/rom-py/rompy/blob/flixible-souce-file/rompy/core/data.py#L87-L95) field could also be passed as the function callable itself rather than a string, in case you are working programmatically from a Notebook for example.",

You will not have them both. The way the featured post works right now is like a stylized first post. This is not good in the context of pagination in which the featured post must be a separate thing.\nIf we want them both, we will make another issue to address this. In this PR we will focus only on pagination.\n\n\n  If the posts block is not placed at the top of the page, switching through pagination will refresh the page and it won't be scrolled to the block. Maybe we can change this for a better UX\n\n\nThis is a hard problem because when you enter into the page, we do not know if you come via pagination or other ways around.  It creates some weird behavior. We will mark it as not an issue since some other competition blocks have the same behavior.",
