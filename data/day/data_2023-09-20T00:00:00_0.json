I went through each place that used it and replaced it with either:\r\n\r\n- inlining the string value (for user-facing Results)\r\n- using an `Exception.raiseInternal` (if the type checker should have caught it)\r\n- adding `TypeChecker.raiseFnValResultNotExpectedType` for `Interpreter.applyFnVal` calls where the type is wrong (I don't have a good sense of how the error should look here, maybe as we use it, it will become clearer)\r\n\r\nI also extended error-stringifying in some cases as needed, with some minor error message upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhile I was there, I ended up greatly simplifying some builtin functions (List, String, and Dict) which had been made really unpleasant as a result of trying to thread DErrors through them, they're much nicer now.",
