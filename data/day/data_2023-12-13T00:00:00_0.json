Then you can submit image queries asynchronously using the `ask_async` interface (read the full documentation [here](pathname:///python-sdk/api-reference-docs/#groundlight.client.Groundlight.ask_async)). `ask_async` submits your query and returns as soon as the query is submitted. It does not wait for an answer to be available prior to returning to minimize the time your program spends interacting with Groundlight. As a result, the `ImageQuery` object `ask_async` returns lacks a `result` (the `result` field will be `None`). This is acceptable for this use case as the **submitting machine** is not interested in the result. Instead, the **submitting machine** just needs to communicate the `ImageQuery.id`s to the **retrieving machine** - this might be done via a database, a message queue, or some other mechanism. For this example, we assume you are using a database where you save the `ImageQuery.id` to it via `db.save(image_query.id)`. \n        \n    \n  \n\n\nDo a ctrl-f and make sure you get all of them since we're changing the base url",
