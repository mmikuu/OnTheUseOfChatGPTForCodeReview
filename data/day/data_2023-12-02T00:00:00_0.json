More detail in this ChatGPT thread: https://chat.openai.com/share/5ff7b3d0-6855-42a6-a3fd-2394e9bd9890\nMy main concern is that Docker containers are designed to run in isolated environments. They don't natively interact with the host operating system's desktop or graphical user interface. We you able to get this working and working with the native UI on an OS?\n__\nGUI Operations: Your application relies on GUI operations (like PyAutoGUI), which might not work seamlessly in a headless Docker container. Additional setup or a different approach might be required for GUI interactions.",

I've optimized the code by consolidating exception handling into a single approach using a dictionary for better efficiency and readability. Redundant code segments have been refactored to avoid repetition, ensuring a streamlined structure.\nRegarding the order of exceptions, I've organized them in specificity, which aligns with best practices for error handling in Python.\nAs for printing and returning, the code previously printed the error and returned an error message. I've adjusted the error handling function to return the error message directly, simplifying the structure and making it more cohesive. This change avoids unnecessary duplication between printing and returning.\nThe updates have significantly improved the code's clarity, maintainability, and adherence to best practices. Thank you for your feedback, which greatly contributed to these enhancements!tion",

Now, whenever the model tries to click on anything, it will send another additional request to GPT giving it a chance to adjust its initial percentage guesses.\r\n\r\nI first extract out the initial guess of where the model tries to click, and then I take a screenshot of a smaller 200 x 200 pixel rectangle around the initial guess. I then upsample the image by doubling the dimensions so it's bigger to GPT (all done in capture_mini_screenshot_with_cursor) and then ask the model to refine its guess, giving it the previous image/message as context as well as the previous X Y coordinate guess it attempted and give it a chance to add and subtract minute percentages (accurate_mode_double_check).\r\n\r\nLocally, this configuration has significantly improved the accuracy of clicking on my desktop configuration (two monitors). Currently I've only implemented it for Linux, but if this approach is liked it can easily be adapted to other OS.\r\n\r\nIdea could be further improved if the add_grid_to_image is further improved such that in the accurate_mode adding grid case to the mini screenshot, if instead of (25%, 25%) in the first intersection, instead it was (-3%, -5%) for example so it was just the relative percentage change. This will probably allow the model to have an easier time adding and subtracting the proper amount in the refined click.\r\n\r\nAlso I almost arbitrarily chose 200 x 200 as the rectangle size. I just noticed that on my desktop, the model would often be wrong by more than 100 pixels away, but less than 200 pixels so I just chose that as the size.\r\n\r\nI would be happy to improve my code, or explain anything as wanted!\r\n\r\nPS: I also added poetry support. But I can delete this and just add all of those files to .gitignore",

I feel like we could adjust the -accurate to also take in a number, like the number of scopes of precision you'd like. -accurate = 3, means 3 layers of scoping.\nI coded this mini screenshot system in a way such that the scoping amounts can all be variables, it's only dependent on ACCURATE_PIXEL_COUNT, which can easily just be a param passed in.\nAlso yeah, I will just delete poetry. 100% not important",

It doesn't always perform well for me, but I think we can iterate it to improve performance.\n-accurate = 3, means 3 layers of scoping sounds like a good approach. We can do this with a later PR.\n\nAwesome, sounds good! I just cleaned up the repo. Going to do a quick round of testing to make sure it all works\nUpdate: it works",

However, I've noticed that it sometimes seems to prioritize looking at the mini-screenshot over the whole screen. So it sometimes gets \"stuck\" in the 200 x 200 area of the screen where the previous guess was.\nTomorrow I'm going to look into refining the accurate mode vision prompt a bit to reduce how often it gets stuck in the 200 x 200 box.\nGreat work on this!",
