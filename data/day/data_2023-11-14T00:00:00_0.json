The file \"supplier_configs_reader_test.go\" includes the addition of a new test function \"Test_ParseSupplierConfigs\" and test cases for valid and invalid service configurations.\n\n2. The Makefile has been updated with changes related to staking tokens for suppliers. The \"supplier_stake\" target has been modified to include the SUPPLIER_CONFIG environment variable, and the SERVICES variable has been replaced with a YAML configuration file for each supplier. Additional targets have been added for staking specific suppliers (supplier1, supplier2, supplier3), each with its own YAML configuration file. A new target \"supplier_unstake\" has been added for unstaking a supplier.\n\n3. A new file \"supplier1_stake_config.yaml\" has been added to the \"localnet/poktrolld/config\" directory. The changes in this file include adding services for apps and suppliers to stake for, making GetSession testable, and ensuring Genesis-staked actors are available via AccountKeeper. Additionally, configurations for the \"anvil\" service and \"svc1\" service have been added.\n\n4. Another new file called \"errors.go\" has been introduced in the \"x/supplier/client/config\" package. This file defines various error variables related to supplier configuration.\n\n5. The file \"supplier_configs_reader.go\" in the \"x/supplier/client/config\" package has also been modified. It contains several structs and functions related to parsing and validating a stake config file for a supplier service.\n\n6. The file \"tx_stake_supplier.go\" in the \"x/supplier/client/cli/\" directory has undergone changes. These changes include import statement modifications, variable additions and replacements, and command description updates.\n\n7. Finally, a new file named \"supplier2_stake_config.yaml\" has been added. This file includes two service configurations with their respective endpoint URLs and RPC types.\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance.\n<!-- reviewpad:summarize:end -->\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\n- #137 \r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\nSelect one or more:\r\n\r\n- [x] New feature, functionality or library\r\n- [ ] Bug fix\r\n- [ ] Code health or cleanup\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n- [ ] Other (specify)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- [x] **Run all unit tests**: `make go_develop_and_test`\r\n- [ ] **Verify Localnet manually**: See the instructions [here](TODO: add link to instructions)\r\n\r\n## Sanity Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have tested my changes using the available tooling\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] I have commented my code, updated documentation and left TODOs throughout the codebase\r\n",

Perhaps x/supplier/client or x/supplier/client/config.\nI think it's reasonable to expose config structs as part of the API to provide programatic usage. I think it makes the pkg more open for extension; why should the cli pkg get exclusive access?\nFollowing-on from 1, I think it would then also be necessary to export these structs.\nRegardless of 1-3, it is necessary to export the fields on these types in order for them to be (de)serializable.",
