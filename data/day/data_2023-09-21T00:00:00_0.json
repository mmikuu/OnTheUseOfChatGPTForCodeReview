I quickly proof-read some parts and it looks okay, but of course there can be mistakes and I have not used the Skill before, so I don't know what some commands may stand for (e.g. I am confused how I can turn off my computer with Nextcloud via this skill now) We can always improve that later. I just thought this won't hurt as a start.\n* As for the keyword Sabia I asked ChatGPT, but it was hardly helpful. I ended up just using \"Nextcloud\" for now, as it is propbably, what it is basically all about.\n\nsource ChatGPT: https://chat.openai.com/share/4c3df48f-27fe-493e-86ac-37124e975a13",
