More importantly, rendering the page expanded and then collapsing it with JavaScript seems like the right thing to do from an accessibility standpoint: We'd want the page to still be useful without JavaScript. I've been known to access API documentation in the terminal with `w3m`, so not relying on JavaScript to render the core content is something I actually care about. Screenreaders probably also wouldn't like if all docstrings initially rendered as `hidden`.\r\n\r\nCloses #2282",

I don't think there's much I can do beyond that. I did test locally that the JS does what it's supposed to (very nicely, in fact). What I could do as an additional test is to use the feature in the Documenter documentation. Maybe collapsing all the Internal API pages by default?",

In my first iteration, it worked fine locally but only 90% of the time in Chrome and only 1% of the time in Safari. I'm guessing the script was running too early. In the current iteration, I've tried to move the <script> tag to the end of the file, but that's still behaving the same way (i.e., not working in Safari). I also tried putting it in an external script (I think local scripts load before external scripts, which may be part of the problem), but that was much more complicated to implement, and then just didn't work at all. I can push that branch again somewhere if you'd like to take a look at it.",

I have found a way which I think will work.\nBasically, what we will do is save all the @meta flags in data attribute of a div element. Something like below,\n<div data-docstringscollapsed=\"true\"></div>\nThen add a js script, which will perform the necessary actions for each flags. For example, like this\n// assets/html/js/metadata.js\n\n// libraries: jquery\n// arguments: $\n\nlet docstringscollapsed = $(\"div[data-docstringscollapsed]\").data();\n\nif (docstringscollapsed) {\n  $(\"#documenter-article-toggle-button\").click();\n}\nDoing this will always ensure that, all the scripts and DOM content will be loaded. Hence, it might mitigate what we are currently facing.",
