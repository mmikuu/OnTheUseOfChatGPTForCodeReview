It uses the entry's name, the relative path, the size and the content type to try and generate a `CID` closest to the file's contents with its metadata.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we cannot use the file's contents to create a `CID` because, with this method (as described in the [LiveView's documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/uploads.html), which is _different from the [regular file upload-way that is used in the API](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/file_uploads.html)_) we do not have access to the file's contents.\r\nI've tried doing this in both LiveView and also in the `js` client but there is no information about where the File is stored (it's not stored anywhere). I've also tried checking if there's a discernable way of seeing the contents of the file in the entry that is used in the Javascript client (e.g. check the screenshot below)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"466\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/dwyl/imgup/assets/17494745/38219d46-1d00-4030-953c-a704ddd22912\">\r\n\r\nSo the closest we can do with the LiveView format is to use its metadata and create the `CID` off of that.",
