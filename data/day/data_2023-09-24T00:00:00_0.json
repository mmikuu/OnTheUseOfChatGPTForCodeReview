I would hope this usecase could be supported with zero-config, but I'm not aware of multi-entry code-sharing features in Rollup.\nI have a workaround like this: bunchee --target es2022 --external ./index &&  sed -i '' \\\"s/'\\\\.\\\\/index'/'\\\\.\\\\/index\\\\.mjs'/g\\\" bundle/server.mjs bundle/bin.mjs && sed -i '' \\\"s/'\\\\.\\\\/index'/'\\\\.\\\\/index\\\\.cjs'/g\\\" bundle/server.cjs bundle/bin.cjs\nLooks like it is possible: https://chat.openai.com/share/8a08b0c6-d5c4-476d-a086-a0053cd8c185",
