This was necessary because keeping both the map state (like zoom, latitude, longitude, etc) and tree state in the same viewState led to tons of problems and unexpected crashes when a viewState update for one view overwrote another. I'm a little weary that this change didn't introduce bugs in other parts of Taxonium, since I was mostly focused on the map view, so this is definitely something to check on.\r\n\r\nCan definitely add more to this PR and fix any problems you may find.

This was originally proposed by Russ, and I believe he mentioned that he knew of some potential users who wanted to upload their own data to be able to better visualize the distribution of the samples on a map, not just their relation in the tree.\nThere could definitely be more work done on colors / more clearly communicating the relationship between the samples and their position on the map. I originally played with the idea of drawing lines between the tree and the map, but that seemed pretty infeasible with some of particularities of deckgl and drawing views on top of each other (the code got incredibly messy without much tangible benefit). I also explored adding a 3D map to better communicate density of samples, but that also proved to be a headache.\nI think a key problem to solve here is communicating the density of samples better, because as you said, right now it's more of just a visual mapping.\nWhat do you think would be the best way to make this sort of change as compatible as possible with future development? I'd be happy to write some tests or clean up the changes in if that would be of any help.\n(I'm also not super sure about the merges, I had to do a bit of fiddling locally to pull in the upstream changes since my local copy was stale, but the merged copy worked fine afterwards)",

For me that doesn't  provide a lot of utility for users. In general we don't have a pattern that as you zoom in on the tree that anything else changes, with the exception of the Key (but the Key is integrated into the tree panel so that makes sense). In my vision for Taxonium, zooming the tree should not affect the map (or anything else). Instead, selecting a node would probably cause the map to update to display information about the descendant nodes. Searches also might be represented on the map as well as the tree.\nI think some quantitative represenation on the map is going to be crucial. It's worth having a look at how Nextstrain (or Microreact) goes about this. I think I probably imagine something relatively similar for Taxonium. But in our case I think the slider to select a date window would be built into the map panel. But there's a lot of work to get there, probably with extra backend routes.\nIn terms of future-proofing, this is both about making sure that things are moving in the direction of the vision above, and also about configurability. At the moment there are more-or-less no hardcoded metadata fields, so country doesn't need to be called country, and samples don't need to have a country, they could have a city or something instead. In the public tree (as you've seen), country has values \"England\", \"Scotland\" and \"Wales\". So we would want to use a geojson for that with those countries separate. For other trees a geojson with \"UK\" may be appropriate. For analyses of a particular country, a map of that country with points distributed by city may be appropriate. I think I'd imagine something like a field in the config JSON which could be configured like:\ngeoData : [\n{name: 'Sampling country',\ngeoJson: 'http://example.com/mygeojson.json' (or raw geojson),\nmetadata_field: 'country'\n},\n{name: 'Sampling city',\ngeoJson: 'http://example.com/mygeojson2.json' (or raw geojson),\nmetadata_field: 'city'\n},\n{name: 'Departure country', // (for travel cases)\ngeoJson: 'http://example.com/mygeojson.json' (or raw geojson),\nmetadata_field: 'departure_country'\n},\n]",

The nodes issue is solved locally but that's spawned a few more problems to look into :)\nI get what you mean about the map updating as the tree is manipulated, which is a new pattern. I think the selection approach you mentioned should be possible, since currently the map is updated using the nodes as the set of data (which as far as I could tell during development updates to be all nodes in the main viewport), and it would just be a matter of hooking up the selected node and it's descendants to the map. The metadata json would also be possible, and a lot more flexible than the current approach.\nI've looked at the Microreact implementation, and it looks like they rely on a histogram view alongside the map view, with a pie chat centered on each region showing proportions of different samples there. That should be possible, but would be a solid chunk of work to implement. I'd be happy to take a look at it, but I am wondering what the development process should be here. Since the current work is in progress, would it be best to keep it in a draft PR that I update as I go, or should changes be merged into a feature branch in the main Taxonium repo and then merged in to master when finished?",

I really don't have preferences about how we go about the process of moving closer to that. I'd definitely be happy to accept merges into a feature branch at any time.\nUnfortunately I think it will need work at the backend - the way things are set up the client is only available of a downsampled version of the dataset depending on how you zoom. The closest current analogue for this is the \"getTipAtts\" feature. We would need to create a new backend route from the local and server backends that gets the total counts for an attribute for each country. I can help with that aspect (at least).",
