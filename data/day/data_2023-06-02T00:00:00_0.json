Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. \ud83d\udea8\r\n\r\n__PLEASE READ THIS__:\r\n\r\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval, we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the task.\r\n\r\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\nAlso, pelase note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details \ud83d\udcd1\r\n### Eval name\r\nviewport_to_grid_size\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\nEvaluates a models ability to determine the size of an obscured grid using information only from initial constraints and a visible viewport.\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\nRequires the model to go beyond simple instruction following to solve a task that requires pattern recognition and interpretation.\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>\"GPT4 Pattern Recognition\"</summary>\r\n\r\n\r\n> The AI could benefit from better pattern recognition in problems like this, to understand how the relationship between parts of a system (like a viewport and a larger grid) can reveal information about the whole system. \r\nhttps://chat.openai.com/share/4aeb8ed6-6dff-4f26-a946-aefe8c2fa511\r\n\r\n\r\nI provided the prompt (submitted in this eval) to ChatGPT and tried to get it to reword the prompt by telling it that I didn't understand it. \r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>(original) prompt for reference</summary>\r\n\r\n\r\n`Given a viewport into a larger grid, calculate the total number of cells in the grid. The grid consists of cells, each labeled with an index. The labeling starts at 1 in the first cell located in the top left corner of the grid and increments by 1 with each step. The final cell in the bottom right corner of the grid is the size of the grid. The viewport shows only a small portion of the (square) grid. Provide the answer directly, or the mathematical representation e.g (rows * cols)`\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nGPT-4 proceeded to misinterpret the task (which I expected), but when I challenged it's assumptions with the original facts provided it realized that my original instructions were sufficient and the prompt didn't require any changing. \r\n> The original instructions you provided were quite clear in retrospect. The misunderstanding was on my part for not correctly identifying the pattern from the viewport. The instructions were providing all necessary information for someone to identify the grid size by observing the numerical pattern in the viewport.\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval \u2705\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can  create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n## Eval structure \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\r\n\r\nYour eval should\r\n- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`\r\n- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at `evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`\r\n- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\r\n\r\n(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)\r\n\r\n## Final checklist \ud83d\udc40\r\n\r\n### Submission agreement\r\n\r\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the right to use this data in future service improvements to our product. Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).\r\n\r\n- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.\r\n\r\n### Email address validation\r\n\r\nIf your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email address associated with the merged pull request.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.\r\n\r\n### Limited availability acknowledgement\r\n\r\nWe know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission, help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the right expectation before you open this PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted.\r\n\r\n### Submit eval\r\n\r\n- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form\r\n- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data\r\n- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push\r\n\r\nFailure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being closed.\r\n\r\n### Eval JSON data \r\n\r\nSince we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\r\n\r\n  ### Eval\r\n  ```jsonl\r\n{\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are given a subsection of a grid G, labled 'Viewport'.
