More importantly, rendering the page expanded and then collapsing it with JavaScript seems like the right thing to do from an accessibility standpoint: We'd want the page to still be useful without JavaScript. I've been known to access API documentation in the terminal with `w3m`, so not relying on JavaScript to render the core content is something I actually care about. Screenreaders probably also wouldn't like if all docstrings initially rendered as `hidden`.\r\n\r\nCloses #2282",

I don't think there's much I can do beyond that. I did test locally that the JS does what it's supposed to (very nicely, in fact). What I could do as an additional test is to use the feature in the Documenter documentation. Maybe collapsing all the Internal API pages by default?",

In my first iteration, it worked fine locally but only 90% of the time in Chrome and only 1% of the time in Safari. I'm guessing the script was running too early. In the current iteration, I've tried to move the <script> tag to the end of the file, but that's still behaving the same way (i.e., not working in Safari). I also tried putting it in an external script (I think local scripts load before external scripts, which may be part of the problem), but that was much more complicated to implement, and then just didn't work at all. I can push that branch again somewhere if you'd like to take a look at it.",

I have found a way which I think will work.\nBasically, what we will do is save all the @meta flags in data attribute of a div element. Something like below,\n<div data-docstringscollapsed=\"true\"></div>\nThen add a js script, which will perform the necessary actions for each flags. For example, like this\n// assets/html/js/metadata.js\n\n// libraries: jquery\n// arguments: $\n\nlet docstringscollapsed = $(\"div[data-docstringscollapsed]\").data();\n\nif (docstringscollapsed) {\n  $(\"#documenter-article-toggle-button\").click();\n}\nDoing this will always ensure that, all the scripts and DOM content will be loaded. Hence, it might mitigate what we are currently facing.",

I've previously seen a third party site advocating for this standard but I couldn't find it today so the above link is a ChatGPT conversation.)\nRather than return the value stored in the \"CI\" environment variable, I think it is sufficient to list it in 'extra_flags' or similar, or just as its own boolean (\"True\" means present\").\nWdyt?",

I was saying that this could break frontends because they have the following flow:\n\nBackend constructs txn and sends it to frontend to sign\nFrontend signs and sends to /submit-transaction\n/submit-transaction calls BroadcastTransaction (this thing) and returns\nThen the frontend refreshes under the assumption the txn is in the mempool and its effect will show up after the refresh.\n\nIf we delete this thing then it could cause frontends to miss the txn's effect on refresh. A few ways to fix this:\n\nHave frontend wait for inclusion in a block, which will take a bit of time. Not a big deal. We could wait for a post but maybe not a diamond or things like that.\nAlternatively we could be smarter about how we render things in the mempool in the frontend.\n\nI don't think we have to worry about this for now. I'm just mentioning for when you encounter it later.",

For example, if the peer has A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F and you're at just A and the peer sends you F, then you will try to connect F, fail, then request E, then you'll get E, try to connect it fail and request D, and so on. I don't think we need to optimize this right now because nodes will generally be nearly-synced at this stage. But leave a comment that this behavior exists if it's correct.\nOne way to fix this is to send your tip inside the GetBlocks message, and then the node can auto-send you everything from your tip to its tip. But again I think this is probably a premature optimization we don't need to make right now. If you like that optimization then leave it as a TODO for fun.",

The GetHeaders thing does a sophisticated \"common ancestor\" check between the two nodes by sending an exponentially-backed-off list of your headers, eg: tip, tip-1, tip-2, tip-4, tip-8, tip-16, ..., genesis. This covers cases where nodes are super divergent, which can happen in Bitcoin but can't happen in PoS so it doesn't make sense to port it over. Instead, sending the committed tip only, and then having the node send you its next N blocks from the tip automatically, seems like the \"most right\" thing to do with PoS. But again I think what you have works and just adding a TODO is good and will work great.",

By the time we get here, we're guaranteed that our tip will be within MaxTipAge of the \"true\" tip on the network, where MaxTipAge is 24h. Specifically, the order is: 1) sync all the headers, 2) download all the blocks for those headers, 3) the next thing that would trigger with your code is _handleBlock().\nIf we assume the above, then we could potentially be an hour or more behind at step (2) causing the first tip block we get to do a lot of catch-up. I think this is probably fine, since an hour of blocks is only 3600 little blocks. But it's something to keep in mind as your testing. And if it's slow or suboptimal, you can do the update to add your committed tip to GetBlocks() that I mentioned previously.",

You can open identity and hit \"advanced\" on the part where it shows you a seed phrase and then see how it converts it:\nhttps://ibb.co/wwW1rKH\nMy thinking is it would probably be good to make it so that the flag is a mnemonic, and that the seed hex used is identical to that generated by identity, which is standard bip39 generation.\nI could also see the argument for keeping it as raw seed hex. In that case we'll just have to tell people to copy it from the advanced section or something. Also it feels easier to lose a seed hex than a mnemonic but idk.",

It is inefficient, but my expectation was also that by the time a validator is in the steady state consensus, it will be nearly synced with all of its peers that this isn't an issue.\n\nOne way to fix this is to send your tip inside the GetBlocks message, and then the node can auto-send you everything from your tip to its tip. But again I think this is probably a premature optimization we don't need to make right now. If you like that optimization then leave it as a TODO for fun.\n\nYour comment is a big unlock for better optimizing the syncing here. I'll add the TODO with context + link to this comment. This will be a straightforward optimization if we ever need it.",

You would need everyone to upgrade their flags at the exact same time or else the network would break.

Based on my analysis, it seems like we should hit a RuleErrorRuleErrorParentBlockHasViewGreaterOrEqualToChildBlock at the PosCutoverHeight2. I'll explain why it looks like this to me, and maybe you can tell me what I'm missing:\ngenesis\n* block_producer.go\n* Miner queries for template with height = Pos2CutoverHeight\n* Finds winning hash\n* Sends it to /submit-block\n* Gets to _handleBlock() with a PoW block that has height << PosCutoverHeight2\n* srv.fastHotStuffConsensus.HandleBlock() is skipped because IsRunning() is not true\n* ProcessBlock calls processBlocPoW because < PosCutoverHeight2\n* block_producer.go and miners get busy producing the next PoW block...\n\nGood so far!\n\n\nPoW height = PoSCutoverHeight - 1\n* A block is mined with height = PoSCutoverHeight - 1\n* Gets to _handleBlock()\n* srv.fastHotStuffConsensus.HandleBlock() is skipped because IsRunning() is not true\n* ProcessBlock calls processBlocPoW because < PosCutoverHeight2\n* block_producer.go and miners get busy producing the next PoW block...\n\nPoW height = PoSCutoverHeight2\n* Here's where it gets weird. Notice that block_producer.go does NOT set ProposedInView to anything, so I assume it's zero for all PoW blocks, including this one.\n* _handleBlock() is called on this last PoW block\n* BUT ProcessBlock calls processBlockPoS because = PosCutoverHeight2\n* We et to -> getLineageFromCommittedTip -> getCommittedTip -> returns PoW block with height = (PosCutoverHeight2 - 1)\n  - This works because all PoW blocks return IsCommitted() = true. Still good so far...\n* Where we get screwed is I think we end up returning RuleErrorParentBlockHasViewGreaterOrEqualToChildBlock in getLineageFromCommittedTip() because we never set the view in any of our PoW blocks.\n\n\nI was searching around to see if maybe we were implicitly setting ProposedInView to the height somewhere but I couldn't find anywhere we were doing it. Not sure how we could ever get past getLineageFromTip() with a PoW block without setting ProposedInView to the right value in the parent.",

For context, Bitcoin has a really weird way of dealing with time that we sortof emulated before, but that we're not going to be porting over to PoS.\nFor PoS, we want to simply set the block timestamp to:\ncurrentTimestamp = MIN(time.UnixNano(), parentBlock.TstampNanos + 1)\nCritically, the nodes on the network should allow for some amount of drift, say a few minutes, but should reject blocks outside of that strict time range. Bitcoin does this rejection but its window is 2 hours or so, and it does not enforce monotonically increasing timestamps, which causes complications (it would be better if it did).\nI remember we decided that monotonically increasing the timestamp would prevent attacks, but now that I'm thinking about it I'm not 100% sure we need it. It prevents attacks in Proof of Work because the timestamp is used by Proof of Work to adjust the difficulty, but I don't think we rely explicitly on the timestamp for anything in consensus itself, and so I think just having it be currentTimestamp = time.UnixNano() would probably work. In this case, a validator can fudge the time up to our strict time window for one block, but then the next validator would correct it.\nThe above being said, I recommend keeping monotonically increasing timestamps unless we have a good reason not to have them. Among other things, they lead to more consistent behavior for things that rely on the timestamp, such as lockups. In the specific example of lockups, you could have a weird case where a lockup is unlockable for one block but not unlockable for the next, which is kinda dumb (though not fatal).\nSo I would just leave a comment explaining as much as you can about the relevant context above.\nAlso just as a history lesson, I believe Bitcoin Core sets its timestamp based on the median of what its peers tell it the time is or something like that. I don't know if it still does this, but I think that's how Satoshi had it. It prevents your clock from drifting too hard from everyone else's clock, so that you're always suggesting blocks that are within their window.",

I would rewrite this as:\nmp.RLock()\nreadOnlyPointer = mp.readOnlyLatestBlockView\nmp.RUnblock()\n\nnewView, err := readOnlyPointer.CopyUtxoView()\n\nThis works because we never modify the value of readOnlyLatestView. Instead, we just change the pointer. So you only need to guard the pointer access, not the copy.\nI've always used locks for these cases, but a pointer-copy is so chill I thought maybe Go made it so that it's guaranteed to be atomic. And I think on most hardware the pointer-copy IS atomic, meaning you don't even need a lock around it. But it looks like it's not a guarantee so best to keep the guard you have there.\nThis was my research:\nhttps://chat.openai.com/share/f8aade6f-7822-484a-9057-f656f7429669\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/yb1ijr/race_or_not_race/",

Instead, we just change the pointer to point to a new view. This means that the code for updating this value, as well as the augmentedLatestBlockView value, is much more efficient than it was with the legacy mempool. The reason is that the legacy mempool used to require a view-copy to be inside of a lock, whereas we only need a pointer-copy to be inside of a lock. Much better than before! Which means we can have a lower time between each update. I recommend 10ms.",

I think _addTxn is called when we initialize the mempool, which means you'll be blasting it with txns.

You can just look at the diff and make sure that the position of BlockUntilReadOnlyViewRegenerated hasn't changed, and make sure it makes sense why it hasn't changed.",

It uses jwtService.verify to validate the token and throws a NotFoundException if the user does not exist, which aligns with the PR objectives and the AI-generated summary.\n\n\n16-16: The import of jwtConstants is used correctly in the verifyAccessToken method to provide the publicKey for token verification.\n\n\n\nbackend/src/chat/chat.module.ts (2)\n\n\n14-14: The change to export ChatService aligns with the PR objectives to enhance the chat functionality and is correctly reflected in the module's decorator.\n\n\n13-13: The inclusion of AuthModule in the imports array is consistent with the PR objectives to integrate authentication into the chat functionalities.\n\n\n\nbackend/src/room/room.module.ts (2)\n\n\n5-10: The addition of ChatModule to the RoomModule imports is consistent with the PR objectives to integrate chat functionalities into room-related features.\n\n\n5-10: Verify that the addition of ChatModule does not introduce circular dependencies with RoomModule or other modules.\n\n\n\nVerification successful\nThe previous script contained an error due to the use of an unrecognized flag -Ttypescript with rg. I will correct the script and execute it again to verify the potential circular dependencies.\n\nThe output indicates that RoomModule is used within app.module.ts, but it does not provide direct evidence of a circular dependency between RoomModule and ChatModule. To verify the presence of a circular dependency, I need to check if ChatModule also imports RoomModule. I will create a script to search for instances where RoomModule is imported in the files that import ChatModule.\n\nThe script failed because of an incorrect regex pattern. I will correct the regex to properly search for instances of RoomModule being imported in files that import ChatModule.\n\nThe output indicates that RoomModule is imported in app.module.ts, which is the same file that was identified earlier. However, there is no new evidence of RoomModule being imported in any file that imports ChatModule. This suggests that there is no direct circular dependency between RoomModule and ChatModule based on the information available.\nGiven the results, it appears that the addition of ChatModule to RoomModule does not introduce any circular dependencies, at least not in the direct manner that would be detectable with the provided search.\n\n\nScripts Executed\nThe following scripts were executed for the analysis:\n\nScript:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Check for potential circular dependencies involving RoomModule and ChatModule\nrg -Ttypescript \"ChatModule\" --files-with-matches | xargs rg -Ttypescript \"RoomModule\"\n\nLength of output: 154\n\n\nScript:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Check for potential circular dependencies involving RoomModule and ChatModule\nrg \"ChatModule\" --files-with-matches | xargs rg \"RoomModule\"\n\nLength of output: 234\n\n\nScript:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Search for RoomModule imports within files that import ChatModule\nrg \"ChatModule\" --files-with-matches | xargs rg \"import {.*RoomModule.*}\"\n\nLength of output: 187\n\n\nScript:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Search for RoomModule imports within files that import ChatModule\nrg \"ChatModule\" --files-with-matches | xargs rg \"import.*RoomModule\"\n\nLength of output: 143\n\n\nbackend/test/chat-gateway.e2e-spec.ts (2)\n\n218-234: > Note: This review was outside the patches, so it was mapped to the patch with the greatest overlap.
