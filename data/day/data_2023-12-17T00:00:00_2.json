And different schedulers are not possible, as in \"ipvs\".\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\nFor start this is a PoC.\r\n\r\nA more suitable name than `numgen` should probably be used in the proxier structure. Trying to look into the future, one might expect some new features in nftables, like maglev-hashing\", and make it possible to configure those future things without altering the config API, just use a new value for some distribution parameter.\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n\r\n```release-note\r\nAllow users to configure the distribution in proxy-mode=nftables to mimic proxy-mode=ipvs with round-robin\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Additional documentation e.g., KEPs (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals), usage docs, etc.:\r\n\r\n\r\n",

More importantly, rendering the page expanded and then collapsing it with JavaScript seems like the right thing to do from an accessibility standpoint: We'd want the page to still be useful without JavaScript. I've been known to access API documentation in the terminal with `w3m`, so not relying on JavaScript to render the core content is something I actually care about.

I don't think there's much I can do beyond that. I did test locally that the JS does what it's supposed to (very nicely, in fact).

In my first iteration, it worked fine locally but only 90% of the time in Chrome and only 1% of the time in Safari. I'm guessing the script was running too early. In the current iteration, I've tried to move the <script> tag to the end of the file, but that's still behaving the same way (i.e., not working in Safari). I also tried putting it in an external script (I think local scripts load before external scripts, which may be part of the problem), but that was much more complicated to implement, and then just didn't work at all. I can push that branch again somewhere if you'd like to take a look at it.",

I have found a way which I think will work.\nBasically, what we will do is save all the @meta flags in data attribute of a div element. Something like below,\n<div data-docstringscollapsed=\"true\"></div>\nThen add a js script, which will perform the necessary actions for each flags. For example, like this\n// assets/html/js/metadata.js\n\n// libraries: jquery\n// arguments: $\n\nlet docstringscollapsed = $(\"div[data-docstringscollapsed]\").data();\n\nif (docstringscollapsed) {\n  $(\"#documenter-article-toggle-button\").click();\n}\nDoing this will always ensure that, all the scripts and DOM content will be loaded. Hence, it might mitigate what we are currently facing.",

I think this implementation would treat the empty string as 'unset', which makes sense I think. In the implementation files, I was originally going to recommend checking for \"DO_NOT_CHECK\" not in os.environ but that check would not work if we want the empty string to count as not being set.\nI'm totally okay with either approach. Just calling out the distinction to make sure we're not missing anything.",

Luckily, the industry has a convention:\nhttps://chat.openai.com/share/eb500944-8bb6-43a1-b64e-5f901f4587c4\n(Turns out \"CI environment variable\" is hard to google. I've previously seen a third party site advocating for this standard but I couldn't find it today so the above link is a ChatGPT conversation.)\nRather than return the value stored in the \"CI\" environment variable, I think it is sufficient to list it in 'extra_flags' or similar, or just as its own boolean (\"True\" means present\").\nWdyt?",

So, something like DUCKDB, POSTGRES, SNOWFLAKE, etc\n\nYes, that's what the TODO on top is meant for.\n\nEven though it wouldn't contain much, we could also adopt the \"TelemetryInfo\" convention to be parallel with the source side. In that case, this would be a \"CacheTelemetryInfo\" dataclass, perhaps just with one member, and would render as a dict instead of a string in the telemetry object.\n\nGood suggestion, I will adjust it like that - maybe we want to add other dimensions later on.",
